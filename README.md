## Expressway to Data Science: Python Programming

How many times have you decided to learn a programming language but got stuck somewhere along the way, grew frustrated, and gave up? This specialization is designed for learners who have little or no programming experience but want to use Python as a tool to play with data. 

In the first course, Introduction to Python Fundamentals, you will learn the basic input and output methods in Python, so you can write your first program. You will  learn variables, operations, and flow control statements for more advanced programming. In the second course, Introduction to Python Functions, you will create and use functions to make your programs reusable and adaptive. You will also learn how to utilize basic packages. In the third course, Python Packages for Data Science, you will gain familiarity with the packages specifically used for data science, such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 

In this specialization, you will learn that programming in Python is like building with LEGO: you simply follow instructions, choose the pieces that fit together, and create something fulfilling and unique. Instead of giving up in frustration, you will discover that learning Python can be easy and fun.

### Applied Learning Project

Learners will become familiar with Python and essential packages for data science  through exploratory labs and guided examples. Starting from one single-line Python statement, learners will be able to utilize the most widely used Python packages to play with data and gain insights from data.
